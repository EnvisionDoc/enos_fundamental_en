# EnOS services and functions overview

EnOS™ is an IoT operating system with comprehensive features and services for device provisioning and management, data integration and processing, machine learning, and data visualization. EnOS provides end-to-end tooling to enable the rapid deployment of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications that integrate and process heterogeneous dynamic data sources from smart IoT devices across enterprise information systems.

## Identity & Access Management (IAM)

Supports multi-tenancy through applying the identity and access management (IAM) scheme, where each tenant in EnOS is managed as an organizational unit. Data that belongs to different organizations are securely segregated and can only be accessed by users that are registered to the organization. For more information, see [IAM overview](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/iam/en/1.0/).

## Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service

For more information, see [LDAP overview](link to LDAP 1st topic).

## Device Modelling

Enables abstraction and standardization of device data from different manufacturers to be unified into a small number of common models and thus facilitates application processing. EnOS™ Cloud has accumulated a large set of device models in its model library. For more information, see [Device modelling overview overview](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/1.0/device_modelling/).

## Stream Computing

Powered by Apache Spark™ Streaming with Envision’s customization and optimization, provides access to the abstract computing models of user devices and sites and allows you to run your codes through the SDKs/APIs provided by EnOS™ for flexible customization based on your business needs. For more information, see [Stream computing overview](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/online-data/en/1.0/)

## Event Management

Enables you to receive, process, and generate events on your devices. The service also allows you to define event triggering rules against the device data, to achieve real-time alarming and troubleshooting. For more information, see [Event management overview](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/event-management/en/1.0/).

## Data Integration

Supports synchronizing data between extensive heterogeneous data sources, such as to synchronize structured data from source databases to the Hive Library in EnOS Cloud and from EnOS Cloud to external target databases. For more information, see [Data Integration overview](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/offline-data/en/1.0/data_integration/)

## Data IDE

Enables batch data processing from simple data transformations to complete ETL (extract-transform-load) through providing visualized and friendly user interface that help you scheduling workflows. Provides common libraries out-of-the-box for most frequently used data processing operations. For more information, see [Data IDE](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/offline-data/en/1.0/data_ide/).

## Data Explorer

Based on the open-source Apache Zeppelin project, lowers the barrier for data
processing, and enables data-driven, collaborative, interactive data analytics
through providing web-based notebook. For more information, see [Data Explorer overview](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/analysis-report/en/1.0/data_explorer/)

## BI & Report

The EnOS native data analytic and reporting tool, provides full lifecycle
functions around data analytics from data source connection, dataset generation,
to data visualization. Can be inserted to your operation system or exist as
independent portals. Lowers the barrier of acquiring, processing, and analyzing
data through providing interactive drag-and-drop user interface that help you
build data analysis reports rapidly and thereby avoid duplicate efforts in
front-end development. For more information, see [BI & Report](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/analysis-report/en/1.0/bi_report/).
