# 2019/06

The 2019/06 release of EnOS offers the following updates:

## What's New?

This section lists the new services and features in this release.

### Common Services

We added support for resource management so that you can scale up and down according to your business requirements, and be alerted when resource usage reaches pre-configured threshold.

#### Resource Management

You can request batch computing resources, data warehouse and file storage HDFS. You can also change your resource quote and set alarms for usage.

- **Resource requesting**: you can request the following computing and storage resources on EnOS Console through specifying resource specifications that match your business needs.
  - Stream analytics
  - TSDB
  - Batch computing
  - Data warehouse
  - File storage HDFS
- **Resource scale-down**: When your business needs stablize but the resource quota exceeds your actual needs, You can scale down the resource specifications to save costs.
- **Resource usage alarms**: To avoid insufficient resource from impacting your business operation, you can set a threshold for your resource usage. When usage exceeds the threshold, an alarm is triggered against it.


For more information, see [Resource Management](/docs/enos/en/latest/resourcemanagement/overview).

### EnOS Edge

EnOS Edge 2.0 is generally available. 

In this release, EnOS Edge offers almost the same APIs and stream computing capabilities as provided by EnOS cloud. EnOS Edge 2.0 is more than a gateway device, it can be depolyed as an on-site platform that runs independently from EnOS Cloud to support edge scenarios that require local management, analytics, and decision-making such as energy, industry and commercial building domains. Applications that originally runs on EnOS cloud can now be delpoyed on the edge platform. On-site applications can also be migrated to the edge platform.

#### Edge Services on Cloud

- Edge management: supports searching Edge Gateway, viewing current version of edge gateways, viewing publication state and connection state.

#### Edge Platform

- **Data forwarding**: Forwards data to 3rd-party systems or devices through the IEC104 protocol
- **Breakpoint resumption**: When the network is interrupted, EnOS Edge will cache the data in the local datastore and resume transmission once the connection recovers. You can select whether to transmit the latest data or cached data first after network recovers from an outage.
- **Active-Standby Redundancy**: Supports the following types of deployments for high availability:
  - Associate a single edge device with two data sources
  - Associate the active and standby edges to a single data source
  - Associate the active and standby edges to two data sources. 
  
  APIs that help determine active and standby Edges are provided.

- **Device connectivity and management related services**: Provides model, product, asset, asset tree, and alart service APIs that are the same as what's provided on the EnOS Cloud.
- **Data service**: Provides the same data service APIs as EnOS cloud, including data query and local subscription.
- **Local application based on local APIs**: The support of APIs on edge enables applications to run locally to accelerate controls and decision-making.

For more information, see [EnOS Edge](/docs/enos-edge/en/latest/edge_overview).

### Device Management

We added support for non-DTLS CoAP and the device simulator.

#### Non-DTLS CoAP

Through the non-DTLS CoAP tunnel, data is transmited in plain text. You can decide whether to encrypt the data based on your security requirements. For more information, see [CoAP-based Connection and Communication (Non-DTLS)](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/reference/coap/coap_non_dtls/connection_non_dtls).

#### Device Simulator

You can use the simulator to simulate sending sample data to EnOS Cloud. You can use the simulator for testing and debugging purposes. For more information, see [Using Device Simulator](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/device/manage/using_device_simulator).

.. image:: ../media/device_simulator.gif

#### Model Inheritance Path

Adds the support of field `modelPath`, which records the parent model and the inheritance path of a model. This facilitates query and data processing based on model inheritance.

#### Issuing Cached Commands

For scenarios where a device is offline (for example, NB-IoT device in its sleep mode), while an application needs to issue commands to the device such as the set value for measuring point, or to invoke services of the device, EnOS supports to cache commands in a queue within the period of validity and allows you to issue the cached commands. When the device is connected to EnOS again, EnOS sends the cached commands to be executed. You can view the command state from the console. For more information, see [Managing Cached Commands](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/device/manage/viewing_command_status).

.. image:: ../media/viewing_command_state.gif

#### Searching and Internationalization

- Support for searching devices by model, device key and asset ID, and filter the search result by node type and connection state.
- Support for searching devices and logical assets by measuring point name and identifier
- Support to specify device name in both Chinese and English through the internationalization control

#### API Optimization

We released API v2.0 to enhance the stability and usability of existing APIs, especially for device, asset tree, and alert related APIs.

For more information, log into EnOS Console and select **EnOS API**.

### Data Asset Management

We added support for time series data insights, data quality report, meta data exploring, and data archiving. 

#### Time Series Data Insights

Support for easy query and visualization of data stored in TSDB. For AI and PI type measuring points, queried data can be further aggregated; for DI type measuring points, queried data can be device status change data only. The queried data can be presented in line chart or table. For more information, see [Data Insights Overview](/docs/data-asset/en/latest/howto/storage/data_insights).

.. image:: ../media/data_insights.gif

#### Data Quality Report

Data governance supports data quality detection by completeness, accuracy, and timeliness dimensions. Data quality reports can be generated for models, measuring points, and assets in a specific time range. For more information, see [Data Quality](/docs/data-asset/en/latest/learn/data_quality).

.. image:: ../media/data_quality.gif

#### Data Asset Explorer

Support for data asset metadata exploring capability with the data asset explorer. You can query the metadata of models and measuring points, including the basic information, storage policies, stream processing lineage, and related instance list. For more information, see [Data Asset Explorer](/docs/data-asset/en/latest/learn/metadata_explorer).

.. image:: ../media/data_asset_explorer.gif

#### Data Archiving

We added support for archiving data from real-time message channel. Data that is ingested from devices and processed by the streaming engine can both be stored into specified storage system. For more information, see [Data Archiving](/docs/data-asset/en/latest/howto/archive/archive_policy).


### Data Analytics

We support synchronizing data stored in Azure BLOB Storage into EnOS HDFS. New system variables and data development SDK are also added. 

#### Data Integration

You can now synchronize files stored in Azure BLOB Storage into EnOS HDFS. For more information, see [Synchronizing Files from External Databases to HDFS](/docs/offline-data/en/latest/data_integration/creating_scratch_blob2hdfs).

#### New System Variables

The following system variables are added:

- `${hcal_dt8}`: Using business date and time as the basis, move 1 hour backward and export the current date. The format is *yyyymmdd*.
- `${cal_hr}`: Using business date and time as the basis, move 1 hour backward and export the current hour-level number. The format is *hh*.

For more information, see [Supported System Variables](/docs/offline-data/en/latest/system_variables).

#### New Data Development SDK

An new SDK `HivePartitionDroppedSDK` is added to support deleting both the meta data of specified Hive partition and the stored data. For more information, see [Common Library](/docs/offline-data/en/latest/common_library).

### Application Development

We added menu and permission management, application authorization under the System OU, EnOS API enhancement and documentation enhancement. In APIM, we added support for mapping constant parameter and OU authorization.

#### Menu and Permission Management

Users can authorize customers to use specific menus in an application, or grant them certain permissions to resources.


#### Authorization by System OU

Users can authorize customers to use applications by using the System OU account.

For more information, see [Managing Applications](/docs/app-development/zh_CN/latest/managing_apps).

#### EnOS API Documentation Enhancements

We redesigned EnOS API, supporting multiple languages and viewing older versions. The previous API documentation remains accessible.

### APIM

APIM provides unified API management, such as rate limiting and IP control list. Signature is removed from APIM.

- API hosting: Users can host API and set its gateway to provide API users unified access and authorization methods.
- Rate limiting: Users can limit throughput against an API, rejecting excessive calling to assure service stability.
- IP access control: Users can add an IP to blacklist or white list to control its access, enhancing API security.
- API, its backend and constant parameter mapping.
- OU authorization in basic parameter of a new API added to authorize an SA which calls an API of a `ORGID`.

For more information, see [EnOS APIM](/docs/api-mgmt/en/latest/).

### Service Hosting Center (SHC)

Initial release. SHC provides highly available container management service. It helps project managers create and manage projects and applications, and helps developers configure container, and quickly build and deploy applications. SHC simplifies the configuration and management of container, and creates the ideal container operating environment in the cloud.

#### Container Service

- Configures deployments and allocates resources for applications and services.
- Supports Kubernetes Stateful Sets in automatic container deployment. Stateful Sets support environment variables, thus enabling JVM self-adaptation within container. 
- Creates service configuration with route, so that applications can expose Web services to outside the cluster.
- Uses routes to expose pod IP and cluster IP, so that k8s pods can be accessed from outside the cluster.
- Uses config maps to store attribute-level information or overall information such as configuration or JSON objects. Config maps store key-value pair configuration that can be used in pods. It is similar to secrets but config maps are more suitable for dealing with non-credential strings.
- Uses secrets to configure password, token, and keys without exposing them to images or Pod Specs.

#### Toolkit Integration

- Redmine
- Jenkins
- Gitlab
- SonarQube
- Nexus
- NPM
- Harbor

#### DB Container Integration

- Redix
- MySql
- Mongo

#### Log Service

Supports log and alarm services.

For more information, see [About EnOS Service Hosting Center](/docs/apaas/en/latest/about/apaas_overview).
