### Common Resource

We added the IAM Service API, supporting query of detailed organization information with organization ID. We also added support of offline message channel and HDFS storage type in data archiving. Details are as follows:

#### IAM

- User must reset the initial password after first login or after the administrator resetting the password.

#### Data Archiving

- Added support of archiving data that is integrated from the offline message channel. When creating a data archiving job, select the **Offline Message Channel** as the data source.

- Added support of HDFS storage type to store archived files. To use the HDFS storage, you need to request the file storage HDFS resource through Resource Management. For more information, see [Archiving Data](/docs/data-asset/en/latest/howto/archive/index.html). 

<!--

### EnOS Edge

#### Stream Analytics

- Added support of StreamSets-based stream analytics capability on EnOS Edge.
- Added support of all general StreamSets operators that EnOS Cloud supports and photovoltaic-industry-specific StreamSets operators. For more information on what operators EnOS Edge supports, see [Edge Computing](/docs/enos-edge/en/latest/learn/edge_computing#streamsets-operator-reference).
- Added support of StreamSets capability for EnOS Edge high availability (HA) deploying modes.
- Added support of StreamSets Pipeline configuration and management GUI as supported by EnOS Cloud.

For more information on how to develop StreamSets operators on EnOS Edge, see [Developing with StreamSets Operators](/docs/data-asset/en/latest/howto/stream/streamsets).

#### TSDB

We added support of TSDB on EnOS Edge. Details are as follows:

- Added support of reading from and writing data to the TSDB on EnOS Edge. Relevant APIs are provided to query from and write to TSDB.
- Added support of second-level storage of raw data and one-minute-level storage of normalized data.
- Added support of EnOS Edge HA. TSDB can be deployed on both the active and standby Edges to support HA deploying mode.

#### IAM and Application Portal on EnOS Edge

- Added support of identity and access management (IAM) on EnOS Edge.

- Added support of Application Portal on EnOS Portal, including application integration and permission management.

### Device Management

We added support of attribute-based alert rule, last update time and ranking of model elements, and device data forwarding. Details are as follows: 

#### Alert

- In **Alert Rule**, we added support of setting the attribute of a device as alert threshold. Devices of the same model may need alerts of different thresholds for the same measurement point in various scenarios. You can set the threshold as the attribute of a device when creating this device. Then, during creating an alert rule, select the attribute instead of a fixed value as the threshold to trigger the alert. For more information, see [Tutorial: Setting Different Alert Thresholds for Devices of the Same Model](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/alert/set_alert_rule_for_device).

#### Model

- Added support of displaying last updated time for model elements, including measurement points, attributes, events, and services. Developers can make use of these last updated times to determine whether a device is online or functioning properly.
- Added support for displaying the ranking of model elements. In the JSON file and Excel sheet of a model, the model elements are ranked based on their **Ranking** or **Priority** number, time of creation, and identifier. You can use the ranking to quickly locate the elements when, for example, you want to match data collected from a device to measurement points. For more information, see [Managing Model](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/model/managing_model).

#### Device Management

- Added support of forwarding device data to multiple device instances. You can forward the data collected from one physical device to multiple device instances of the same model on EnOS Cloud. This can be used in scenarios where one physical device must be bound to several nodes on the same asset tree. For more information, see [Forwarding Data From a Physical Device to Multiple Device Instances](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/device/manage/mirroring_device_data)

### Data Asset Management

We added support of cleaning up historical data stored in TSDB, developing stream data processing jobs with StreamSets operators, storing and querying data quality indicator, and filtering alert data with asset tree tags in creating data subscription jobs. Details are as follows:

#### Time Series Data Cleanup

Support for cleaning up historical data (wrong data, informal data, or useless business data) that is stored in TSDB for releasing storage resource and saving data storage costs. For more information, see [Cleaning up Stored Data](/docs/data-asset/en/latest/howto/storage/clearing_data.html).

.. image:: media/data_cleanup.gif

#### StreamSets Operators

Support for a set of underlying packaged StreamSets operators for developing customized and advanced stream data processing jobs to meet the requirements of various business scenarios. For more information, see [Developing with StreamSets Operators](/docs/data-asset/en/latest/howto/stream/streamsets.html).

.. image:: media/streamsets.gif

#### Storing and Querying Data Quality Indicator

Support for storing and querying data quality indicator in TSDB. When querying data stored in TSDB through TSDB Data Service APIs, the data quality indicator will be returned in the response. For more information, see the TSDB Data Service API documentation.

#### Filtering Subscribed Alert Data with Asset Tree Tags

Support for filtering subscribed alert data with asset tree tags in configuring data subscription jobs. Alert data of the specific asset trees can be subscribed to with this feature enabled. For more information, see [Developing Data Subscription Jobs](/docs/data-asset/en/latest/howto/obtain/managing_data_subscription.html).



### Application Enablement

#### API Management

- Exporting APIs: export the APIs and save it as JSON file. Then transfer the APIs to another EnOS environment, or do APIs backup.

- Importing APIs: import the APIs configuration file (JSON) which was previously exported into EnOS for API batch creating. 



#### Service Hosting Center 

- New job type "Custom" is supported in **Pipeline**. User can run the script file in the repository. 

- The **Deployment** supports **Autoscaler**. User can change the configuration of replicas, average CPU utilization, and average memory.

- The **Storage** supports configuring storage type (Block or Filesystem) and access mode (ReadWriteOnce or ReadWriteMany).

#### EnOS Graph Editor

We released EnOS Graph Editor V2.0, enabling engineering professionals to configure SCADA pages efficiently. The Graph Editor provides a set of easy-to-use base shape and icon elements, which satisfies the requirement of various business scenarios.

Purchase the EnOS Graph Editor application through **EnOS Console > Application Registration** and download the installation package through the **EnOS Console > SDK Center**. For more information, see [About EnOS Graph Editor](/docs/app-development/en/latest/hmi/hmi_overview.html).
