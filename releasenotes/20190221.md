## What's New?

The 2019/02/21 release of EnOS Cloud image offers the following new services, features, and enhancements:

### Device Management

#### Support of Statistics Dashboard

EnOS Device Manager now supports the dashboard function that provides the statistics of device connections. The dashboard shows the connection status of devices and the statistics of inbound and outbound messages, thereby, enables you to quickly determine the situations and make business decisions.

The statistical indicators are mainly targeting to the device management and operation staffs. This new feature provides statistical data of the current account at near real time. The feature also provides data and visualization of key business indicators such as concurrent connections and message transmissions of user-specified time span.

The EnOS Device Manager service currently provides the following statistical indicators:

.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - Indicator
     - Description
   * - Overview
     - The total number of products and devices that are created in the current account till the current day, and the message throughput of the current day.
   * - Online devices
     - Number of devices maintaining long connection with IoT Hub in the specified time cycle, classified by protocol type.
   * - Trend
     - Number of registered, activated, and online devices in the specified time cycle.
   * - MQTT Messages (Bytes)
     - Amount of inbound and outbound messages in byte in the time cycle.
   * - MQTT Messages (Count)
     - Number of inbound and outbound messages in the specified time, assuming average message size is 512 bytes.

To access the device dashboard, click **Device Management > Overview** from the left navigation of EnOS Console.

In addition to the **Overview** section at the top of the page, you can view the statistics of all or select products for your designated time span. The dashboard provides convenient time filters to help you show the statistics of the recent 1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days.

Because the dashboard features adopts a static visualization panel technology, delays might occur for data presentation. You can click the **Refresh** icon to show the latest data.

#### Support of Dynamic Activation of Devices

Support to activate devices through the `productKey`, `productSecret` and `deviceKey`. The `deviceSecret` is retrieved dynamically when the device attempts to log into EnOS Cloud. Dynamic activiation helps to achieve batch registration and login of devices. For more information about dynamic activation, see [Secret-based Authentication](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/learn/deviceconnection_authentication.html).

#### Updates to Device SDK for Java

The device SDK for Java adds support for:

- NTP synchronization
- Dynamic Activation of Devices

To obtain the latest Java SDK, go to https://github.com/EnvisionIot/enos-mqtt-sdk-java.

### Data Asset Management

This is the initial release of the Data Asset Management service.

EnOS Data Asset Management service targets to help you optimize your total cost of ownership for your data assets on EnOS. The service mainly brings the following benefits:

- Stronger data analytics capability
- Higher data development efficiency and lower barrier of stream data processing development
- Lower cost of data storage due to more flexible configuration
- More effective data retention and access based on domain expertise accumulation

The following features are provided in the initial release of Data Asset Management service:

#### Stream Analytics

The essence of stream analytics is to ensure low-latency of stream data transmission and processing, as well as high accuracy of analytics. To achieve these goals, EnOS Stream Analytics not only provides high throughput, low latency stream processing, but also accumulated the leading and most frequently used stream processing algorithms for certain industries. The service provides visualized template-based configuration to help you quickly perform your stream analytics tasks and task monitoring. The initial release of stream analytics provides the following features:

- Lifecycle management of stream processing tasks: create, configure, run, and monitor tasks.
- Window aggregation for analog input (AI) data.
- Support aggregation calculation based on event time. Deals with event disorder and time deviation and provides meaningful result based on the actually event time.
- Provide rich aggregation algorithm, including max, min, avg, sum, and cnt.
- Support time window latency to deal with the late-arrival data.
- Support various threshold ranges. Input data that exceeds the threshold will be processed by the interpolation algorithm.

For more information about EnOS Stream Analytics, see [About EnOS Stream Analytics](/docs/data-asset/en/latest/learn/index.html).

#### Data Service APIs

As the infrastructure of EnOS, APIs play a critical role in application development. To enhance the data store and access efficiency, EnOS abstracts the data classification and storage pattern of the utility industry and provides corresponding APIs for different storage:

- `getAssetsAIRawData`: Corresponding to the TSDB data storage policy of the raw analog input (AI) data. Gets the AI raw data of certain measure points of specified assets in a time range.
- `getAssetsAINormalizedData`: Corresponding to the TSDB data storage policy of the normalized AI data. Gets the minute-level normalized AI data of certain measure points of specified assets in a time range. The aggregation methods supported are: `count`, `avg`, `sum`, `max`, `min`, `first`, and `last`.
- `getAssetsGenericData`: Corresponding to the TSDB data storage policy of the generic data. Gets the generic data of certain measure points of specified assets in a time range.
- `getAssetsRawDataByTimeRange`: Gets the raw data (AI, DI, PI, and generic data) of certain measure points of specified assets in a time range.

To view the API documentation, log into the EnOS Console and go to **EnOS API > API Documents**. Summary of APIs is displayed in tables by API service categories.

#### Data Subscription

Data subscription targets to improve the API calling efficiency of applications with active data push, which supports subscription to various data types such as real-time asset data, asset alert data, and asset metadata.

The initial release of data subscription provides the following features:

##### Multiple data source subscription

- Support the subscription of real-time asset data
- Support the subscription of asset alert data

##### Visualized configuration

- Provide GUI that allows you to customize the data subscription configuration, such as creating, configuring, starting, stopping, or deleting subscription topics.
- Support to subscribe data of different clients through application authorization.
- For real-time data subscription, supports to filter data in terms of measure points and asset tags.

##### Data subscription SDK

SDK is provided for application developers to consume subscribed data.

- Support SDK for Java and provide corresponding MAVEN dependency and GitHub source code.
- Consumes data in the `pull` model, to realize flow control on the client side.
- Support one topic to be subscribed by multiple consumer instances in the shared cost or repeat cost model.
- The data stays in the subscription topic for 3 days.

For more information about data subscription, see [Data Subscription Overview](/docs/data-asset/en/latest/learn/data_subscription_overview.html).
