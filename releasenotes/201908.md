- Added support of the asset tree-based alert masking feature. By configuring this feature, you can receive only the alerts from the parent nodes and mask the alerts from all the child nodes so as to reduce the invalid alerts received by the application. For more information, see [Masking Alert](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/alert/masking_alert).

#### Device Management Service

- Added support of updating the properties of device instances in batch by uploading an Excel sheet, which includes the device name, time zone, and attribute information. For device names, added support of updating both the default name and name in locale languages.

- Added support of adding and deleting gateway sub-devices in batch for easy configuration.

#### Model Service

- In addition to importing and exporting model information in a JSON file, added support of editing model information by importing and exporting an Excel file to improve model management efficiency and ease of use. To use this feature, open the **Model Details** page for the model you want to edit, click **Feature Definition**, and click **Export Model** and **Import Model**. For more information, see [Managing Models](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/model/managing_model).

#### Connection Service

Provided the `replaceDevice` API to replace the `DeviceKey` of an asset with the `assetId` unchanged. The `DeviceSecret` will be automatically reassigned by the system. This API is applicable to the scenario where the device is repaired and replaced.

### Application Enablement

#### API Management

- The API hosting process supports the mapping of constant parameters: In the mapping mode, you can combine multiple URLs by configuring constant parameters to reduce repetitive work and improve API development efficiency. For more information, see [Creating APIs](/docs/api-mgmt/en/latest/creating_api.html#api-backend).

#### Service Hosting Center (SHC)

- From the **Project** menu, you can view all the projects that you have permission to access, as shown in the following image

  .. image:: media/allproj_en.gif

- Under the **Member** tab of the **Application** page, added support of searching for members, as shown in the following image.

  .. image:: media/pipe_schedule_en.gif

- Added support of directly creating **Deployment** and **Stateful Set** when adding a deploy job for a new pipeline, as shown in the following image.

  .. image:: media/pipe_deploycreate_en.gif


- Added the **History Records** for **Container** (except for **Storage**), which helps you to view the historical configurations of container and supports rollback to the historical configuration state. For more information, see [Configuring Deployments](/docs/apaas/en/latest/howto/container/configuring_deployment.html#id4).


- Added support of viewing details of deployment resources in the application list page of **Container**, as shown in the following image.

  .. image:: media/container_details_en.gif

## What's Changed?

This section lists the enhancements and behavior changes in this release.

### EnOS Edge

- Edge Platform Service API: Improved the authentication mechanism.
- A new version of the asset model APIs is provided on the basis of API Management, and the original APIs remain unchanged.

### Device Management 

This release mainly optimizes the search behaviors and the interactive behaviors of the asset tree. Details are as follows:

#### Search

The following updates are made to the product list search box:

- Support for fuzzy search
- Support for search based on the internationalization control, ie:
  - If the product name is set respectively in different language environments through the internationalization control, it is supported to search for the corresponding name value in the corresponding language environment, that is, searching for English names in the English environment and Chinese names in the Chinese environment.
  - When no corresponding language is set in the internationalization control of the product name, the entered search query is matched against the default value defined in the internationalization control.


For the usage of the internationalization control, see [EnOS Console GUI Conventions](../overview/ui_conventions).

#### Asset Tree

Asset tree batch operations and page interaction optimization, including: 
- Optimized the display of asset tree root asset nodes and tree information.
- When you attempt to associate an asset to a node, only assets that are previously not associated are displayed for choice. If an asset has been associated to other nodes in the current asset tree, it is no longer displayed.
- Search optimization:
  - Support for fuzzy search for `ProductKey`, `DeviceKey`, model identifier (`modelId`), etc.

  - Added support for advanced search. You can click **Advanced Search** next to the asset tree search box to return the search records based on the set search criteria.

#### Device Connection

Optimization for "per-product secret" authentication protocol:

| Original Behavior | Current Behavior |
|----------|----------|
|   After EnOS issues the `deviceSecret` to a device, no `device_secret` will be issued regardless of whether the device is activated by the `deviceSecret`.   |    A device can still request and get the `deviceSecret` if the device does not carry a `deviceSecret` for activation after EnOS issues a `deviceSecret` to the device. This improvement is mainly applicable for the scenario where the `deviceSecret` is missing.  |


### Data Analytics

Data IDE common library: The **Master Data Synchronization** SDK has been upgraded to V0.2.1 with a new column added to record the model and measuring point information.

### Application Enablement

#### API Management

- Added the message prompt for the interruption of API staging process.

- Deleted the message box for response parameters.

#### Service Hosting Center (SHC)

- When creating an application, either **Deployment** or **Stateful Set** for a container can be created, i.e. it is not allowed to create both.

- Optimized the pipeline creation process.

- The default values of **CPU Maximum** and **Memory Maximum** of **Resource Quota** when creating **Deployment** and **Stateful Set** are changed to "1.0 Cores" and "1.0G" respectively.

- The **Number of Files** when creating a **Storage** container is changed to 10 million.

- Optimized the pipeline execution status page.

- **Docker Registry** is selected by default when creating a pipeline.

- Optimized the password display operation in the service directory, and modified the password creation rules to support for uppercase/lowercase English letters, numbers and !@#$%^&*/-, with no password displayed during editing.

- **Type** is selected by default when creating a **Service**.

- **Type** is selected by default when creating **Redis**, **Mongo** and **MySQL**.

- **Pod IP** is not displayed before until the health check is completed for **Redis**, **Mongo** and **MySQL**.
