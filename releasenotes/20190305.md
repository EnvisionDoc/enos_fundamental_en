## What's New?

The 2019/03/05 release of EnOS Cloud image offers the following new services, features, and enhancements:

### Device Management

#### Firmware Upgrade Over-the-air (OTA)

This is the initial release of OTA service.

As part of device lifecycle management, adds support of device firmware upgrade over the air. With this support, firmware version of devices can be managed on EnOS Cloud. 

- Provides device SDK to enable devices to report firmware information, request upgrade, and report upgrade result. To use the latest Java SDK that contains OTA, go to https://github.com/EnvisionIot/enos-mqtt-sdk-java. If you are using Maven, update the maven dependency to 2.1.2:

  ```
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.envisioniot</groupId>
    <artifactId>enos-mqtt</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.2</version>
  </dependency>
  
  ```

- Supports of end-to-end lifecycle management of device firmware.
- Supports to configure upgrade policies for devices, EnOS automatically maintains upgrade tasks by pushing upgrade requests to devices that meet the policy requirements through MQTT messaging channel.
- Supports to trace the firmware upgrade logs and diagnose the reason of upgrade failure.

OTA facilitates the fixing of firmware defects and upgrade of device functions over the air, thus, reducing costs in maintaining remote devices. This support is enabled by default in the console. You can access the service through **Device Management > OTA**

#### Reporting Device Measure Points in Batch

Starting from this release, a device can report newly added measure points to EnOS cloud in batch. This feature can be used for the following scenarios:

- A gateway device reports the measure points of its sub-devices.
- A device reports measure points with different time stamps in batch at one time.
- A mix of the above scenarios.

For more information about the feature and samples, see [Reporting Device Measure Points in Batch](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/nonsdk/upstream/device_else/report_points_batch.html).



### Data Asset Management

#### TSDB Storage Policy

This is the initial release of the TSDB Storage Policy service.

The TSDB Storage Policy service allows you to configure data storage options such as which data to store and how long the data persist in a certain storage, thus reducing data storage costs and enhancing data access efficiency.

The initial release of TSDB Storage Policy provides the following features:

##### Storage policy groups

- Supports to create storage policy groups to manage the storage policies of different projects or domains. 
- A standard organization can have 2 storage policy groups. 

##### Storage policy configuration

- Supports to configure policy for AI Raw Data, AI Normalized Data, DI Data, and Generic Data.
- For each storage policy, supports to select measure points of a certain type and configure the data storage time.
- Provides different APIs for you to access data in different storage.

##### Storage policy logs

User operations to storage policies are recorded in logs for diagnosis and detection in the future.

.. note:: You must configure the storage policy. Otherwise, your device data will not be stored in EnOS TSDB by default.

- A storage policy is bound to a device model and the table fields are defined by the measure points of the bound model. Therefore, When new measure points are defined for a model, corresponding storage policy must be updated for the new measure points.
- When storage policy is defined for a measure point, the point type and data type of the measure point cannot be changed. Otherwise, the stored data of the measure point cannot be retrieved by Open APIs.

For more information about TSDB Storage Policy, see [Configuring TSDB Storage](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/data-asset/en/latest/configuring_tsdb_storage.html).

#### Data Service APIs

To enhance the data store and access efficiency, EnOS provides the following new API:

`getAssetsStatusData`: Corresponding to the TSDB data storage policy of the digital input (DI) data, this API can be used to get the status data of specified assets in a time range. The API returns only the data that reflects asset status changes. For example, if the original data in a time range is: 

```
Time       Status 
10:01:14    0
10:01:30    0
10:03:45    0
10:12:23    1
10:13:34    0
10:15:24    1
10:17:25    1
```
The returned result is:

```
Time       Status 
10:01:14    0
10:12:23    1
10:13:34    0
10:15:24    1
```

The EnOS Service SDK for Java is updated to support the `getAssetsStatusData` API, which can be obtained from the [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.envisioniot/enos-api) of EnOS SDK.

To view the API documentation, log into the EnOS Console and go to **EnOS API > API Documents**.

#### Stream Analytics

The Stream Preview feature is added to the Stream Analytics Service for testing data processing streams. After a data aggregation stream is designed, it can be tested and tuned with a small batch of data. When a preview task runs, it will intercept and process the latest real-time data, and the processed data will not be saved in the database. With the preview results, you can debug and tune the data processing stream. If the preview results meet the expectation, you can start running the stream.

For more information about the Stream Preview feature, see [Monitoring Data Aggregation Stream](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/online-data/en/latest/monitor_ai_pipeline.html).



## What's Changed?

### Data Asset Management

#### Data Subscription

In this release, Data Subscription service has the following enhancements:

##### Error message optimization

When a subscribed data source (model or measure point) is deleted, the system will keep the data subscription configuration, but an error message will be displayed, reporting that the configured data source is an unknown object. 

##### Authentication anomaly detection

For existing data subscription configuration, the expiration of service account and data access authorization is dynamically detected. The data subscription configuration is updated accordingly for any authorization changes within 5 minutes. 

- When a service account is deleted, the data subscription configuration will be automatically disabled. 
- When a client revokes the data access authorization of a service account, the related subscription to the client's data will be stopped automatically.

For more information about data subscription, see [Data Subscription Overview](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/data-asset/en/latest/data_subscription_overview.html).
